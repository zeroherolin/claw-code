Search the user's claude.ai plugin catalog by keyword. Call this when a plugin (slash command, skill bundle, hook, or agent) from the user's org catalog might help complete the task. The user does not need to name a plugin: search when the task depends on their team's own process, systems or data and nothing you already have, the project's own scripts included, covers it.

Examples:
- "use the deploy plugin" → keywords ["deploy"]
- "is there something for linting?" → keywords ["lint", "format", "code quality"]
- "ship this to staging" → keywords ["deploy", "release", "staging"]
- "review this contract against our playbook" → keywords ["legal", "contract", "playbook"]
- "which deals close this week?" → keywords ["sales", "pipeline", "crm"]

Do not search unasked for one-off questions or tasks you can handle directly ("explain this regex", "fix this typo"), or after the user ignored a suggestion in this conversation.

Returns a ranked list with id, name, description, and whether the plugin is already enabled for this session (in a channel session, whether the channel has it). When results fit and SuggestPluginInstall is among your tools, call it to render the install card; otherwise relay the relevant results in text instead. If nothing relevant, proceed without mentioning that you searched.
