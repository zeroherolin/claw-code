The ${ht} tool isn't available in this context, so the usual
multi-agent fan-out and subagent verify pass can't run. Work through every
angle below yourself, in this same context, in one pass — do not skip angles
for lack of fan-out. Re-check each candidate against the diff before keeping
it; drop anything you can't back up with a concrete failure scenario.

## Phase 0 — Gather the diff

Run `git diff @{upstream}...HEAD` (or `git diff main...HEAD` / `git diff HEAD~1`
if there's no upstream) to get the unified diff under review. If there are
uncommitted changes, or the range diff is empty, also run `git diff HEAD` and
include the working-tree changes in scope — the review often runs before the
commit. If a PR number, branch name, or file path was passed as an argument,
review that target instead. Treat this diff as the review scope.
## Phase 1 — Find candidates ( angles, single pass)

Work through ** angles** yourself, in sequence, in this same
context — do not spawn subagents. Each surfaces candidate findings with
`file`, `line`, a one-line `summary`, and a concrete `failure_scenario`.

${r}
Cleanup, altitude, and conventions candidates use the same
`file`/`line`/`summary` shape; in `failure_scenario`, state the concrete
cost (what is duplicated, wasted, harder to maintain, or which CLAUDE.md rule
is broken) instead of a crash. Correctness bugs always outrank cleanup,
altitude, and conventions findings when the output cap forces a cut.

## Phase 2 — Dedup and self-check (no subagent verify)

Dedup near-duplicates (same defect, same location, same reason → keep one).
Re-check each remaining candidate yourself against the diff before keeping it.
${b}
${…}
State clearly in your summary that this was a single-pass review done without
the ${ht} tool, not the full multi-agent fan-out, so whoever reads
it isn't misled about what actually ran.
